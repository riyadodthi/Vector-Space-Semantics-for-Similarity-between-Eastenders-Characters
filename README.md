# Vector-Space-Semantics-for-Similarity-between-Eastenders-Characters
In this assignment, we will be creating a vector representation of a document containing lines spoken by a character in the Eastenders script data (i.e., from the file training.csv), then improving that representation such that each character vector is maximally distinguished from the other character documents.
